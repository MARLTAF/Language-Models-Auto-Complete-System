Language Models: Auto-Complete System
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple auto-complete system using N-gram language models — a foundational concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system predicts the next most likely word in a sentence, similar to how search engines or email applications suggest text completions.

Overview:
The goal of this project is to construct an auto-complete prototype that learns from a text dataset (Twitter data in this case) and generates intelligent suggestions based on language probabilities.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:
Tokenization using nltk
Lowercasing and sentence splitting
Handling out-of-vocabulary words using <unk> token
N-gram Language Model:
Supports unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and higher-order n-grams
Computes word probabilities using k-smoothing
Calculates perplexity to evaluate model performance

Auto-Complete Functionality:
Suggests the most probable next word for a given sentence
Combines predictions from multiple n-gram models
Technologies Used
Python
NLTK
NumPy / Pandas
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization) Project Tasks
